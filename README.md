# activitycounts
 Version 0.1 - 25 nov 2020
 This project provides an open-source algorithm to convert raw acceleration data into activity counts. 
 The available files are currently a draft to provide the very basic algorithm.
 The project will be improved in 2021 with improved comments and examples along with a user interface (GUI).
